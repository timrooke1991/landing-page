# landing-page

This was a project to build a landing page for a startup business. The aim of the project was to get me more familiar with Bootstrap while building a full HTML webpage. The site also uses jQuery for some of the functionality.

The site uses a number of Bootstrap features. It uses a Bootstrap navigation, which has been redesigned as well as links, inputs and buttons. The site only has front-end functionality. The email input and login features do not save or submit any data. There is no back-end database attached to the site. 

The site utilises Bootstrap’s scroll spy feature, which automatically update links in a navigation list based on scroll position on the page. This is a useful feature for one page sites with multiple sections. It’s a good feature from a UX perspective and prevents the need load different pages to show new content.

To scale the different sections, I use jQuery to set the required height of each the sections. Therefore, regardless of the size of the browser window at the time that the site loads, the background height will match the height of the window.
